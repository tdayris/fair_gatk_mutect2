Matierial and methods
=====================

Genome DNA sequence and annotations were download from Ensembl. 
Pyfaidx_ [#pyfaidxpaper]_ was used to filter non-cannonical 
chromosomes. Agat_ [#agatpaper]_ was used to correct common 
issues found in Ensembl genome annotation files, filter non-
cannonical chromosomes, and remove transcripts with TSL being
equal to NA. Samtools_ [#samtoolspaper]_ and Picard_ [#picardpaper]_ 
were used to index genome sequences.

Raw fastq file quality was assessed with FastQC_ [#fastqcpaper]_.
Raw fastq files were trimmed using Fastp_ [#fastppaper]_ . Cleaned 
reads were aligned over indexed Ensembl genome with Bowtie2_ 
[#bowtie2paper]_. Sambamba_ [#sambambapaper]_ was used to sort, 
filter, mark duplicates, and compress aligned reads. Quality 
controls were done on cleaned, sorted, deduplicated aligned reads 
using Picard_ [#picardpaper]_ and Samtools_ [#samtoolspaper]_.

Read groups were re-defined over aligned reads with Picard_. GATK_
Mutect2_ [#mutect2paper]_ was used to perform germline calling,
following the `GATK Best practices`_ [#gatkbestpaper]_ and the
method described in the GATK germline best practices [#germlinepaper]_.
VariantEval_ [#gatkbestpaper]_ and BCFTools_ [#bcftoolspaper]_
were used to assess variant calling quality. All quality repors 
produced during both trimming and mapping steps have been aggregated 
with MultiQC_ [#multiqcpaper]_. 

The whole pipeline was powered by Snakemake_ [#snakemakepaper]_. 
This pipeline is freely available on Github_, details about 
installation usage, and resutls can be found on the 
`Snakemake workflow`_ page.
